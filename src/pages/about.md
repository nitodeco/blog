Hi, I'm Nico. Nice to meet you!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building things & code.

I'm based in Zagreb, Croatia, and I'm currently working as a software engineer at [dreifach.ai](https://dreifach.ai), where I lead the development of a very cool unannounced product (_spoiler: it saves insurance brokers a bunch of time_).

I mainly develop things for the web, so naturally web development is a primary topic what I write about.

If you wanna get in touch, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicomoehn/).

Btw, if you like how this blog looks, you can check out the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme that I used to build it.
